# Blueprint Demo Common

This is a library module shared by both [demo-coroutines][demo-coroutines] and [demo-rx][demo-rx]. This has nothing to do with **Blueprint** and just provides common code used by both apps:

* Resources
* An in-memory cache
* Domain model
* A couple of utils and extensions

[demo-coroutines]: ../demo-coroutines/
[demo-rx]: ../demo-rx/
